## Coding Standards

### C# Guidelines

- Follow [Microsoft's C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Use PascalCase for public members
- Use camelCase for private fields with underscore prefix (`_fieldName`)
- Use explicit access modifiers
- Add XML documentation for public APIs

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Represents a network bandwidth rule for a specific process
/// </summary>
public class BandwidthRule
{
    private readonly int _processId;
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the process ID associated with this rule
    /// </summary>
    public int ProcessId => _processId;
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Sets the download limit for the process
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="limitInBps">Limit in bytes per second</param>
    public void SetDownloadLimit(long limitInBps)
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### XAML Guidelines

- Use proper indentation (4 spaces)
- Group related properties
- Use data binding instead of code-behind when possible
- Follow MVVM pattern strictly

```xml
<Button Content="Apply Limit"
        Command="{Binding ApplyLimitCommand}"
        CommandParameter="{Binding SelectedProcess}"
        Style="{StaticResource ModernButton}"
        Margin="5"
        IsEnabled="{Binding CanApplyLimit}"/>
```

### Architecture Guidelines

- **MVVM Pattern:** Strict separation of concerns
- **Dependency Injection:** Use constructor injection for services
- **Error Handling:** Proper exception handling and logging
- **Threading:** Use async/await for long-running operations
- **Resource Management:** Implement IDisposable properly

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Use xUnit testing framework
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

```csharp
[Fact]
public void BandwidthLimiter_SetsLimit_Success()
{
    // Arrange
    var limiter = new BandwidthLimiterService();
    var processId = 1234;
    
    // Act
    var result = limiter.SetProcessLimit(processId, 1000000, 500000);
    
    // Assert
    Assert.True(result);
    Assert.Equal(1000000, limiter.GetDownloadLimit(processId));
}
```

### Integration Tests

- Test service interactions
- Test database operations
- Test UI workflows (where applicable)

## Documentation
